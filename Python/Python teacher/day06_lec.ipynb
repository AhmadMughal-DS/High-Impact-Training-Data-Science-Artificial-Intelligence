    "## Introduction to OOP Concepts\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software. The key principles of OOP include encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using OOP\n",
    "- **Modularity**: The source code for a class can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other classes.\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Once a class is written, it can be used to create multiple objects. Classes can also be reused in other programs.\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: New features can be added to existing code easily by creating new classes.\n",
    "- **Maintenance**: The modularity and reusability of OOP make it easier to debug, test, and maintain code."
